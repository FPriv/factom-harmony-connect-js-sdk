### generateKeyPair

Creates a Public/Private Key Pair which can be applied to Identities
during creation or when replacing a key. An Identity's keys are used to
sign and verify messages.

**Note:** You do not need to use our SDK utility to create Public/Private
Key Pairs. Key Pairs can also be generated by applying
[ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) algorithm, however a
special encoding scheme is used rather than simply the raw 32 byte
arrays. For details, please refer to Identity API Documentation [here](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/FD-849_PublishNewIdentitySpec/ApplicationIdentity.md).

**Returns**</br>
A key pair object with Public and Private keys.
- **publicKey:** string</br>
The public key in base58 Idpub format.</br>
- **privateKey:** string</br>
The private key in base58 Idsec format.
